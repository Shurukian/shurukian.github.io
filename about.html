        <p> I am Dakota Valentine, an accomplished Data Analyst and Cathodic Protection Technician.
          Traveling as a CP Tech prepared me for the turmoils of the lowly Data Analyst (and fatherhood).
          Layered by the sweaty life, I am a Rock Climber/Fly Fisher/Bow Hunter turned Full-Stack Software Engineer.
          I am in constant need of a great challenge and I strive to find that
          niche that allows me to make my mark on the world.
